This file contains a list of frequently asked questions and troubleshooting
tips.

1. Where can I get more help?

See the sana-users google group or the wiki, http://sana.mit.edu/wiki. 

2.  Will it work if I install it on something other than Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?

Maybe but we do not officially support other Linux distro's or Ubuntu versions.

3. I want to use sqlite while testing.

Change the DATABASES value in the settings.py file to look like

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'NAME': '/var/local/db/sqlite.db',
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'USER': '',
            'PASSWORD': ''
        },
    }

(You will need to create the /var/local/db directory and update the perms).
